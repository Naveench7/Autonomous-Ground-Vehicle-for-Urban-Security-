# Autonomous-Ground-Vehicle-for-Urban-Security-

## Overview
We are tasked with the responsibility of designing an autonomous robot that will drive around the streets of
Manhattan to find enemy intruders (the enemies) among us who are troubling the civilians (the friendlies) in the
city. The robot must look out for the enemies and eliminate them by scouring through the streets while following
all the traffic rules and should avoid obstacles (if any).
